## Description
I wanted to make a webpage to quickly display different ways to contact me as well as show off some of my work. The navigation bar allows you to email me or take a look at my GitHub. 

## RoadMap
I plan on adding more functionality with JavaScript in the future and continue to update the page with my latest projects
