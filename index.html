                    Hi, my name is Anthony C. Blanco, I'm 18 years old, and I grew up in Torrance California. The thrill of finally figuring out a puzzle or problem has always been a rush for me. Since then I've developed strong problem-solving skills, and grown to be a fast learner of complex ideas. When I am not in school or working, you often find me playing factory-building games, going to the gym, or watching YouTube videos about dumb things that I find interesting about the world. Factory-building games have always had a place in my heart, the idea of just taking a whole bunch of smaller systems and making something huge out is very satisfying, and that is one of the reasons I am looking for a career in software development.
